    <h1 class="All-About-Ginger-Snaps">Origin of Gingersnaps</h1>

    <h2 class="important">The Story</h2>
    <p class="centered-paragraph">Gingersnaps have been around for <strong>centuries</strong>. It is said they originate in Germany where they were created by medieval monks. The earliest speculation is that they were created in the <em>13th century</em> and have now been passed down throughout history, eventually making their way into the hands of early American colonists.</p>

    <h2 class="important">The Story</h2>
    <p class="centered-paragraph">These specific cookies have been a huge part of my life because it is a recipe my grandma gave to me. We have had standing gingersnap dates where we get together just to bake these cookies, and you can really see the evolution when you take a look at all of the different-sized aprons we have. My sister, grandma, and I have loved making these cookies for as long as I can remember, and I treasure all the memories we have made during those times.</p>
